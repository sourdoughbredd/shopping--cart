# Shopping Cart Project

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) shopping cart built with React and Vite. It demonstrates how to build an interactive shopping interface with various features like product listing, cart management, and more.

## Description

The Shopping Cart Project is a web application designed to let users browse products, add them to their cart, and manage their cart with ease. Built with modern web technologies like React for the frontend and Vite as the build tool, this application focuses on robust application logic rather than visual aesthetics. Key features include:

- **Single Page Application (SPA) Principles**: Implemented using React Router with a shared layout across all pages.
- **API Integration**: Seamless handling of API calls using the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com).
- **State Management**: Cart access and management across different pages using the React Context API.
